career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I love computer programming and to build great software, products and team. This is what I enjoy.
      
      Solid experience in distributed, concurrent, scalable, high throughput server side development in Java (and earlier C++), Messaging frameworks [Apache Kafka et al.], RESTFul web services, Service Oriented Architecture, Microservices, Test Driven Development, SQL and NoSQL database design, application frameworks [Spring], caching frameworks [EhCache], ORM frameworks [Hibernate] and Perl/Python based utility scripts.
      
      Expert level knowledge in building client-server, distributed application architecture and microservices using language agnostic messaging framework and RESTful web services API's. Love to design and architect large scale software systems. Believe in the design which is simple and code which is understandable (by humans, not just machines).
      
      Extensive experience of working in Global Capital markets and financial services industry with Global financial giants across front office to back office functions. Solid understanding of complete trade life cycle, different market participants and different exchange and OTC traded products. Also, worked with start-ups in food tech and analytics space helping them build and launch new products to market.
      
      Learning new programming languages and technology's is one of my passion and something I do in my free time. Acquiring a new skill every weekend keeps me going. Another thing I am passionate about is value investing and following global economy, capital markets and stock prices. An avid reader of non fiction books (50 books an year). 
      
      Personally, I am half right brain (intuitive) and half left brain (analytical) kind of a person. A person with diverse range of interests from technology to finance, economy, politics, spirituality, meditation, ancient history, philosophy, mythology and the list is endless.
      
      Professionally, I would like to have a good Global exposure working with different people from different cultures.
